# Hostifully Code Challenge Documentation

## System Design

In this document, we'll discuss the system design approach adopted for the Hostifully code challenge. The project is structured following a modular and scalable architecture, with clear separation of concerns and reusable components.

### Component Structure

- Components are organized into a dedicated directory (`src/ui/components`) to promote reusability and maintainability.
- Each component is responsible for a specific UI element or feature, such as input fields, buttons, or toast notifications.

**Example**:

```
hostifully-code-challenge/
├── src/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── AutoCompleteInput/
│   │   │   │   ├── AutoCompleteInput.tsx
│   │   │   │   └── AutoCompleteInput.styles.ts
│   │   │   ├── Button/
│   │   │   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   │   │   └── Button.styles.ts
│   │   │   ├── Toast/
│   │   │   │   ├── Toast.tsx
│   │   │   │   └── Toast.styles.ts
```

### Page Structure

- Pages are located within the `src/ui/pages` directory, reflecting the different views or screens of the application.
- Each page component represents a distinct page or route in the application, typically containing multiple UI components and handling page-level logic.

**Example**:

```
├── src/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   │   ├── HomePage/
│   │   │   │   └── HomePage.tsx
│   │   │   ├── LoginPage/
│   │   │   │   └── LoginPage.tsx
│   │   │   └── DashboardPage/
│   │   │       └── DashboardPage.tsx
```

### Utility Functions

- Utility functions are grouped into the `src/utils` directory, providing common functionalities that are not specific to any particular component or feature.
- These functions can include data formatting, validation, helper functions, or third-party integrations.

**Example**:

```
├── src/
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── formatDate.ts
│   │   └── validationUtils.ts
```

### Contexts

- Contexts are used for managing global state within the application, allowing data to be shared across different components without prop drilling.
- Contexts are located within the `src/contexts` directory and typically include provider and hook modules.

**Example**:

```
├── src/
│   ├── contexts/
│   │   └── CoverageContext/
│   │       ├── CoverageContext.tsx
│   │       └── useCoverageContext.ts
```

## Conclusion

The system design of the Hostifully code challenge follows a modular and organized structure, with components, pages, utilities, and contexts each residing in dedicated directories. This design promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, enabling efficient development and easier collaboration among team members. By structuring the project in this way, we ensure that the codebase remains clean, manageable, and adaptable to future changes and enhancements.
