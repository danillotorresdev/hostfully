# Hostifully Code Challenge Documentation

## Technologies Used

### React
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications with reusable components. React was chosen for this project due to its flexibility, performance, and large ecosystem of libraries and tools.

### Context API for Global State Management
The Context API in React provides a way to manage state at the application level without the need for prop drilling. It allows components to share data without having to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree. Context API was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use in managing global state within the application.

### Vite
Vite is a fast and minimalist build tool for modern web development. It offers blazing fast cold server start and hot module replacement (HMR) out of the box, making the development experience extremely smooth and efficient. Vite was chosen for its speed and simplicity, allowing for rapid development iterations.

### Linaria
Linaria is a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS in JavaScript with familiar CSS syntax. It provides efficient and performant CSS extraction during the build process, resulting in minimal CSS payload for production. Linaria was chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration with React components.

### Vitest
Vitest is a lightweight testing library for React applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for writing tests, making it easy to write and maintain test suites for React components and hooks. Vitest was chosen for its simplicity, speed, and compatibility with modern React testing practices.

### React Hook Form
React Hook Form is a library for building forms in React with easy-to-use hooks. It allows for efficient form validation and state management without the need for complex class components or external dependencies. React Hook Form was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and seamless integration with React applications.

### Zod
Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows for the definition of strict, type-safe schemas for data validation and transformation. Zod was chosen for its robustness, ease of use with TypeScript, and comprehensive set of validation utilities.
